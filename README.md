# Test case to build nanogallery2 with Vite in Hugo

In [package.json](./package.json) the dependencies are all registered.
These are jQuery and nanogallery2 as system under test and hugo to serve all files.

The div to hook the gallery to is [generated by Hugo](./themes/test/layouts/_default/home.html) on the home page (`id="ng2"`).
Looking at the statically served files by hugo (later on), this is working.

Vite is [configured](./vite.config.mjs) to build [main.js in `src`](./src/main.js).
Hugo will pick the build artifact of Vite up as it is from `static/js`.

In order to run the tests, just install the dependencies by `npm ci`.
Then, run the hugo server by `npm run server`.
The server will keep updating the page once new changes are detected (Vite building will trigger that as well).
To build the actual JS artifact, just run `npm run build` in a separate console.

By default Hugo will run on http://127.0.0.1:1313.
If that port is preoccupied, it outputs the exact host and port that it is using.
Open a browser (optionally open the browser console) and navigate to the Hugo-served page.
